        <p>My name is Caleb Meacham. I am a freshman studying Computer Science. I chose 
            Computer Science as my major because I love to program. I find the process of 
            coding to be extremely fulfilling as I get to problem-solve and see immediate
            results. This means that Computer Science is the natural option for me.</p>
        <br />
        <p>I do not currently have a job, but during high school I worked at the restaurant
            Texas Roadhouse for twelve months. During that time I learned great work ethic.
            I also got better at leading as I got a more substantial role with time. In addition, 
            I got a better understanding of what it is like to work in the food industry.</p>
