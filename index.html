        <p>My name is Caleb Meacham. I am a freshman studying Computer Science. I chose 
            Computer Science as my major because I love to program. I find the process of 
            coding to be extremely fulfilling as I get to problem-solve and see immediate
            results. This means that Computer Science is the natural option for me.</p>
